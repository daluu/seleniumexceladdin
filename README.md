# seleniumexceladdin
A fork/clone of the original from [codeplex](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=seleniumexceladdin)

Since CodePlex has closed down and archived its projects, and the original developer may not be maintaining it anymore. I figure GH here would be a better medium for others to continue work on it (improvements, bug fixes), via further forking and PRs.

For background, some useful reference links relating to the project (might need (Google) translate, if not native Japanese speaker):
